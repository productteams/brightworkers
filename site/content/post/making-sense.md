The CC updated the wheel to reflect the finer nuances needed to describe stain colors of wood varieties more precisely. The new descriptions are more detailed and hence allow homeowners to distinguish between more color choices and get exactly the color they want.

While this is going to be a big change for professional painters, it means a lot to you as a consumer as well. Weâ€™ll explain how the wheel came to be, how pros use it and what the flavors actually mean.
